== Apiman Docker Compose Quickstart Distro

This Apiman Docker Compose quickstart distro allows you to try out Apiman an architecture that is more representative of a real-world deployment.

Please ensure you change any default passwords before going to production.

Please leave feedback on https://github.com/apiman/apiman/discussions[Apiman Discussions^] on GitHub.

Main Apiman repo: https://www.github.com/apiman/apiman

Apiman Docker repo: https://www.github.com/apiman/apiman-docker

TIP: If using Windows, set the working directory variable with `set "$PWD=%cd%"` before running the steps below.

=== 3 step TL;DR

. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.setup.yml up`
. `docker-compose up`
. http://apiman.local.gd:8080/apimanui

=== Quickstart

* Initialise secrets and keys by running: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.setup.yml up`.
** This must be run *before* starting the main docker-compose, and only needs to be run once.
** We will generate self-signed RSA certificates for you to use in Keycloak.
+
The default keysize is 2048 bits. Set the `RSA_KEY_SIZE` environment variable
before running `setup.sh` if you want a different keysize.
+
These are also copied into `.env`, where they can be injected into Apiman, etc.

* Start docker compose: `docker-compose up` or `docker compose up`
* Location of services:
** Apiman Manager UI: `http://apiman.local.gd:8080/apimanui`
** Apiman Developer Portal: `http://apiman.local.gd:8080/portal`
** Apiman Manager API: `http://apiman.local.gd:8080/apiman`
** Apiman Gateway: `http://gateway.local.gd:8080`
** Keycloak Admin: `http://auth.local.gd:8080/admin`
** Keycloak Auth Endpoint: `http://auth.local.gd:8080`
** Elasticsearch: `http://elasticsearch.local.gd:8080`
*** You may want to edit the docker-compose file and bind port 9200.
** link:https://github.com/maildev/maildev[MailDev^] mock mail service: `http://mail.local.gd:8080`
*** You can view Apiman email notifications here
*** All mail goes to same mailbox with this mock server
*** You can distinguish between recipients by looking at the `to` field.

* Default user and password for Apiman and Keycloak Admin:
** Username: `admin`
** Password: `admin123!`

You can edit the values in `.env` if you want to change hostname bindings, passwords, etc.

=== Production notes

==== Apiman

* Assuming you are terminating TLS/SSL on Apiman, the demo self-signed certificates, keystores, truststores, etc., should be replaced with your organisation's versions.

* Components for such as Postgres and Elasticsearch likely should be run in a multi-node setup to provide high levels of resilience and redundancy.
You should make some considerations for backups, etc.

==== Keycloak

* For a real deployment, please run Keycloak in production mode. For this quickstart Keycloak runs in dev-mode, which is very permissive and tolerant of self-signed certs, etc. -- but it is inappropriate for real-world deployments. https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration-production[Refer to the Keycloak production guide^].

* You **must** change the default usernames and/or passwords before going to production.

* Keys are generated and stored in `data/keys`, and then copied into the `.env` file.
Storing keys in plaintext is not usually advised for a production environment; you should consider using a dedicated secrets storage and injection mechanism.
For example, Hashicorp Vault or K8s secrets.
